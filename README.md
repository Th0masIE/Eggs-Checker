# EggBox

Welcome to EggBox, a simple Java program I created with **_Java_** designed to make your egg-packing adventures a breeze!

## Description
EggBox is a nifty tool that helps you organize your eggs into boxes efficiently. It calculates the number of boxes needed to store a given number of eggs and determines the number of leftover eggs that don't fit into complete boxes.

## How to Use
Using EggBox is as easy as cracking an egg! 
- Simply clone the repository or download the `EggBox.java` file. 
- Compile the program with `javac EggBox.java`, and then run it with `java EggBox`. 
- The program will prompt you to enter the number of eggs you have and the box size. 
- In the blink of an eye, EggBox will tell you how many boxes you need and how many eggs are left over.

## Example
Welcome to EggBox!

Please enter the number of eggs: 24



Result:

Number of boxes needed: 4



Thank you for using EggBox!
